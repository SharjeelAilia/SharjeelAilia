- 👋 Hi, I’m @SharjeelAilia  
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to turn coffee into code (and code into money).  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding—and by "learning," I mean Googling every error message I get.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that sound cooler than they actually are.  
- 📫 How to reach me: Just send me memes; I’ll respond faster than I do to emails.  
- 😄 Pronouns: Ustad.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: My code works perfectly.... until someone else tries to run it.
