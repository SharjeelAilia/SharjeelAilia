- 👋 Hi, I’m SharjeelAiliaRamal
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to make my code look smarter than me.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding, and my debugger is now my closest friend.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve less work and more coffee.  
- 📫 How to reach me: Just shout *"Sharjeel!"* into the void—it works sometimes.  
- 😄 Pronouns: Code/Compile/Debugged.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once tried to center a div... three days later, I finally gave up and just aligned my life instead.
